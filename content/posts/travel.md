### Travelling from the UK

From the UK by air or by ferry with your own car.

Passports – Regardless of the legal requirements a passport is the best and recommended travel document, Ryanair demand you have a passport for flights despite the common travel area. You will also need your driving license if hiring a car. If travelling by ferry you will need your driving license and passengers are advised to have a document with photo id.

Drive is on the same side as the UK, speed limits in kilometers per hour. Some motorways have tolls.

Dublin airport is the closest airport to Tyrrellspass and is connected all the way by major roadway/motorway. Using the M50 (ring road around Dublin) is by far the quickest route to and from the airport.  Pay the M50 toll of €3.10 before your journey, or before the 8pm deadline the day after your journey. https://www.eflow.ie/i-want-to/pay-a-toll/

If you intend to cross the M50 toll point in a rental car, you must contact your rental company to find out if your rental agreement covers the payment of toll charges. Some companies will include toll charges in your bill, others will require you to pay all toll charges yourself.

The M50 will connect you to the M4 motorway which also has a toll of €2.90 but it can be paid in cash or by card at the toll bridge.

Phone – to ring a UK number prefix is 0044. To ring an Irish Number from a UK mobile the prefix is 00353
